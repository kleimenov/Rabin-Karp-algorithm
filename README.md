# Rabin-Karp-algorithm
String searching algorithms
The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-matching algorithm that uses hashing to find a pattern (substring) within a text. It is efficient for multiple pattern searches and has an average-case time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
